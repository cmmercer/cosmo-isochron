# cosmo-isochron
A small python library for performing York linear regressions for geochronology.

The isochron.py file holds the core code of the library. The rhomc.py library contains 
additional functions for processing reduced isotopic data to compute error correlation 
coefficients before running functions from isochron.py. The plotIsochron.py file contains
deprecated old code.
